              <p class="text-muted">Kasaragod is home to the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, originally established in 1916 as the Coconut Research Station. It is part of India's National Agricultural Research System under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.[4] According to the Institute, Kerala "lies in the heart of the major coconut growing areas of the country." It is also home to the Indian Society for Plantation Crops, which publishes the Journal of Plantation Crops and holds symposiums on the subject.[5] The Central University of Kerala is also located in Kasargod(Periya hills).</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Chandragiri Fort is a fort built in the 17th century, situated in Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India. This large squarish fort is 150 feet (46 m) above sea level and occupies an area of about seven acres by the side of the river Payaswini. The fort is now in ruins.

                    The fort has an eventful history. In earlier days, the river was considered to be the border of two powerful kingdoms - Kolathunadu and Thulunadu. When Thulunadu was captured by the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kolathunadu kings lost the Chandragiri region to them. During the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the area was administratively looked after by the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. When the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 16th century, Vengappa Nayaka declared independence. Later Shivappa Nayaka took over the reins. He built a chain of forts of which Chandragiri is part.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Bekal Fort was built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres. The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

                    An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.

                  <p class="card-text">Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple or Anantha Lake Temple is a Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake in the little village of Ananthapura, around 6 km from the town of Kumbla in Manjeswaram taluk of Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthanam) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami (Padmanabhaswamy temple) Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down.[1][2]

                    The lake in which the Sanctum Sanctorum is built measures about 2 acres (302 feet square). An interesting spot to keep in mind while visiting the temple is a cave to the right corner of the lake. According to the local legend, the deity Anantha Padmanabha chose to go all the way to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. </p>
