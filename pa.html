          <h1>Palakad</h1>
          <p class="lead text-muted">The commonly held belief is that the name Palakkad is a fusion of two Malayalam words, Pala, which was the name given to barren land during the Sangam period, and Kadu, which means forest. Palakkad is the gateway to Kerala due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats. Malayalam is the generally spoken language in Palakkad as it is the official language. The district have many small and medium rivers, which are tributaries of the Bharathapuzha River. Of the number of dams in Palakkad district, the largest Malampuzha dam is 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from Palakkad city.
