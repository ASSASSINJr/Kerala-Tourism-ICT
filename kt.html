              <p class="text-muted">Kottayam, from the beginning of the ninth century AD, the history of Thekkumkur and of Kottayam are virtually indistinguishable. Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the Kulashekara Empire (800–1102 AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur, and the latter became a vassal of Cochin.

          <h1>Kottayam</h1>
          <p class="lead text-muted">Kottayam is a district in the Indian state of Kerala. Kottayam literally means the interior of a fort—Kotta + Akam. Flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west, Kottayam is a place that is known for extraordinary qualities.
            The royal house of the Thekkumkur ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta. It is believed that the name Kottayam is derived from a combination of the Malayalam words kotta which means "fort" (Thalitilkotta) and akam which means "inside". The combined form, Kottaykkakam, can be translated as "inside the fort".

                  <p class="card-text">The Vaikom Mahadeva Temple is a temple for the Hindu god Shiva in Vaikom, Kerala. The temple, along with Ettumanoor Siva Temple, Kaduthuruthy Thaliyil Mahadeva Temple is considered a powerful trisome. The belief is that if a devotee worships at these three temples before 'Ucha pooja', all the wishes are fulfilled. The Vaikom Mahadeva temple is one of the few temples which is held in reverence by both Shaivaites and the Vaishnavaites. Vaikom's Shiva is fondly called Vaikkathappan. The Shiva Linga here is believed to be from the ‘Treta yuga’ and considered as one of the oldest temples in Kerala where pooja has not been broken since inception. The temple is one of the major Shiva temples in Kerala counted along with the Ettumanoor Mahadevar Temple, Kaduthruthy Mahadeva Temple, Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple, Chengannur Mahadeva Temple, Ernakulam Shiva Temple, Vadakkunathan temple and Thirunakkara Sree Mahadevar Temple.

                  <p class="card-text">Illikkal Kallu is a monolith located on top of the Illickal Malaa in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India.The distance from kottayam railway station to illikal kallu is 57km. Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek less than 1km to reach the summit of the peak. Illikkal Mala comprises three hills, each rising up to 3,400 ft above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu. The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu. There is a ​¹⁄₂-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam connecting these two hills. The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to that of the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal. It is said that the mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here.
