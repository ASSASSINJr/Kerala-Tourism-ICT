                  <p class="card-text">Anamudi is a mountain located in the Indian state of Kerala. It is the highest peak in the Western Ghats and South India, at an elevation of 2,695 metres and a topographic prominence of 2,479 metres. It lies on the border of Devikulam Taluk, Idukki district and Kothamangalam Taluk, Ernakulam district. The name Anamudi literally translates to "elephant's head" a reference to the resemblance of the mountain to an elephant's head. Anamudi Shola National Park was declared as National Park in December 2003 as per Notification No. 12876/F2 2003/F & WLD dated 14.12.2003 of Government of Kerala The first recorded ascent of Anamudi was by General Douglas Hamilton of the Madras Army on 4 May 1862, but it is likely that there had been earlier ascents by local people. Anamudi peak is one of only three ultra prominent peaks in South India. It is also the peak with the greatest topographic isolation within India.It is the highest point in India south of Himalayas. Thus it is known as "Everest of South India".
