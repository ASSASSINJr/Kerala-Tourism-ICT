              <p class="text-muted">In Wayanad, Historians believe that the human settlements existed in these parts for at least ten centuries before Christ. Much evidence of New Stone Age civilisation can be seen in the hills throughout the present day Wayanad district. The Edakkal Caves has 6000-year-old rock engravings from the Neolithic age. The recorded history of this district is available only from the 18th century. In ancient times, this land was ruled by the Rajas of the Veda tribe.</p>

          <h1>Wayanad</h1>
          <p class="lead text-muted">The name 'Wayanad' is derived from 'Vayal Naadu' (Malayalam) which translates to 'the land of paddy fields' in English. Wayanad is an Indian district in the north-east of Kerala state with administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is set high on the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100 meters. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. About 885.92 sq.km of area of the district is under forest. Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribals in this area.

                  <p class="card-text">Edakkal Caves also Edakal, are two natural caves at Edakkal, in Wayanad district of Kerala. The caves are situated 1,200 m above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, on the Mysore Plateau, in the Western Ghats. The Edakkal caves are believed to be camping shelters of the Neolithic community. The cave walls contain a collection of Neolithic rock engravings and images. The major part of images on the cave walls may belong to late Neolithic period. With the exception of Edakkal, no concrete evidence for the existence of a true Neolithic culture in Kerala has so far been discovered. The caves were discovered by Fred Fawcett, Superintendent of Police, Malabar District in 1896 who immediately recognised their anthropological and historical importance. He published an article about the caves in the Indian Antiquary, attracting the attention of scholars. The caverns at Edakkal are not technically caves, but rather a cleft, rift or rock shelter approximately 96 ft by 22 ft, a 30-foot-deep fissure caused by a piece of rock splitting away from the main body. On one side of the cleft is a rock weighing several tons that covers the cleft to form the "roof" of the cave. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Soochipara Falls also known as Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is a three-tiered waterfall in Vellarimala, Wayanad, India. It is surrounded by deciduous, evergreen and montane forests. Locally referred to as Soochipara, the 15-20 minute drive from Meppadi to Sentinel Rock Waterfalls has views of a number of Wayanad's tea estates. The Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is 200 metres and offers a cliff face that is used for rock climbing. The water from Soochipara Falls later joins Chulika River or popularly known as Chaliyar River after Velarimala Hills near Cherambadi in Kerala. Once people reach the parking area, they have to pass through a security check at the entrance where they make sure you don't carry any plastic. It takes 10-15 minutes walk to the waterfalls and water flow is less during summer, which makes it easy to reach the rocks where water falls.
